I'm interested in improving the postdoc experience for UofR postdoc and in bringing positive changes to organizations, communities, and ultimately the world. 

## Optimizing postdoc experience
Postdoc is like a lone wolf in the academia, and they often experience challenges during their training. In view of their challenges, I first joined University of Rochester Postdoctoral Association (UR PDA) as an international postdoc representative in 2020. Together with serving on the International Student and Scholar Advisory Board (ISSAB), I gathered input and provided feedback to UR PDA and International Student Office for addressing the challenges faced by international postdoc at UofR. In 2021, I took on role of Deputy cochair in UR PDA that assisted with overseeing the event planning from 2021-2022.

I have involved in 1) steamlining the postdoc onboarding process with others in URPDA (e.g. welcome email with a list of useful information about housing, insurance, etc); 2) organizing monthly social events (e.g. kayaking, apple-picking event); 3) bringing in outside speakers (e.g. Ivan Wanis Ruiz from public speaking lab, Dr. Tracy Costello from University of South Florida) for professional development workshops; 4) planning social events for National Postdoc Appreciation Week in Mid September (2021-2023); and 5) sharing useful information about available scholarship/fellowship information (to myHub). 

## Promoting the value of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion
Historically underserved populations need to be uplifted in organizations, communities, and societies. In 2021, I collaborated with EcrLife, an online platform for early career scholars, to write three-series articles for bridging the understanding toward the Deaf and Hard-of-hearing populations in the general public. (You could find them via this link https://ecrlife.org/author/tom-tam/) 

In 2022-2023, I served as a Diversity Officer in the UR PDA, where I succeeded to bringing in Diversity Certificate Program (for faculty) to the postdoc community at UofR. This will enhance the awareness and facilitate our postdoc's understanding toward the importance of DEI in academia and other sectors.
