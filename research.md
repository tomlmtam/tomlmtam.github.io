I'm interested in how early-life exposure to toxicants shapes the later-in-life physiological outcomes throughout the lifespan. 

## Understanding how heavy metals influence DNA repair
Arsenic exposure is a global public health issue, and it causes chronic diseases (e.g. cancer) millions of people worldwide through contaminated drinking water. It is known as a mutagen by damaging DNA. I demonstrated that arsenic exposure impaired the more open chromatin architecture necessary for DNA repair by enhancing proteasomal degradation of a key histone acetyltransferase, TIP60, in human cell lines.

## Understanding how heavy metals interrupt protein quality control
During protein translation, ribosome-associated protein quality control is critical to resolving any potential frameshift mutation in mRNA due to collided ribosomes. ZNF598 is a critical quality control sensor of these collided ribosomes, and its mechanisms act through its function as an E3 ubiquitin ligase. Arsenic exposure is known to induce protein misfolding and its mechanisms has not well understood. I demonstrated that arsenic exposure can interfere with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity of ZNF598 through arsenite-binding on its RING finger motif, which leads to proteotoxic stress observed upon arsenic exposure.

## Understanding how heavy metals influence muscle development
Methylmercury (MeHg) is known to induce locomotor defects, especially in those born from exposed mothers who have no-to-minimal symptoms. Congenital Minamata disease is a legacy disaster in Minamata Bay, Japan during 1950s. Many cases of children affected by Minamata disease displayed motor deficit. Not much has been known about how MeHg affects muscle development and its implications on health later-in-life. I aim to understand the molecular initation events of MeHg in latent motor dysfunction observed in adults who experienced early-life exposure to MeHg, through fruitfly models.
